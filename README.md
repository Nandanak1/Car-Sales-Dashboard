  <b>🚗 Car Sales Dashboard | Tableau Project</b><br><br>

  Created an interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Tableau to understand overall sales perfomance. I analyzed data by Region, Brand and Body Style to identify what types of cars were performing best in different markets.<br><br>

  <b>💡 Key Outcomes from the Dashboard:</b><br><br>

  ✅ Provides real-time visibility into sales performance across regions and brands.<br>
  ✅ Identifies top-selling car styles, colors, and regions for improved business targeting.<br>
  ✅ Monitors year-over-year growth to measure strategic progress.<br>
  ✅ Simplifies complex data into dynamic, interactive visuals for faster decision-making.<br><br>

  This Dashboard provides clear visibility into Sales perfomance, helps to identify which products and regions are performing well, and support faster decision-making.
